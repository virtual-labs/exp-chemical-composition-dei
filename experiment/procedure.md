### Procedure

**a) Preparation of Cement Solution:**
1. Weigh approximately 1 g of the cement sample accurately using an analytical balance.
2. Transfer the sample to a beaker and add 20 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid ($\text{HCl}$).
3. Heat the mixture gently on a hot plate until the cement dissolves completely.
4. Filter the solution to remove any insoluble residue and collect the filtrate in a clean beaker.

**b) Determination of Calcium Oxide ($\text{CaO}$):**
1. Add ammonium hydroxide ($\text{NH}_4\text{OH}$) dropwise to the filtrate until the solution is slightly alkaline (pH ~8-9).
2. Add 10 mL of ammonium oxalate (($\text{NH}_4)_2\text{C}_2\text{O}_4$) solution to precipitate calcium oxalate.
4. Weigh the dried precipitate and calculate the percentage of $\text{CaO}$ using stoichiometric relationships.
1. Add ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH) dropwise to the filtrate until the solution is slightly alkaline (pH ~8-9).
2. Add 10 mL of ammonium oxalate ((NH₄)₂C₂O₄) solution to precipitate calcium oxalate.
3. Filter the precipitate, wash it with distilled water, and dry it in an oven at 110°C.
4. Weigh the dried precipitate and calculate the percentage of CaO using stoichiometric relationships.

**c) Determination of Silicon Dioxide ($\text{SiO}_2$):**
1. Acidify a portion of the filtrate with dilute nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$).
2. Evaporate the solution to dryness to convert silica into insoluble $\text{SiO}_2$.
3. Filter, wash, dry, and weigh the residue to determine the percentage of $\text{SiO}_2$.
2. Evaporate the solution to dryness to convert silica into insoluble SiO₂.
3. Filter, wash, dry, and weigh the residue to determine the percentage of SiO₂.

**d) Determination of Iron Oxide ($\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) and Aluminum Oxide ($\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$):**
1. To another portion of the filtrate, add ammonium hydroxide ($\text{NH}_4\text{OH}$) until a precipitate forms.
2. Filter the precipitate, which contains Fe(OH)₃ and Al(OH)₃.
2. Filter the precipitate, which contains $\text{Fe(OH)}_3$ and $\text{Al(OH)}_3$.
3. Dissolve the precipitate in dilute $\text{HCl}$ and determine $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ and $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ using volumetric titration with potassium permanganate ($\text{KMnO}_4$) and sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$), respectively.

**e) Determination of Magnesium Oxide ($\text{MgO}$):**
1. Use the remaining filtrate to precipitate magnesium ammonium phosphate ($\text{MgNH}_4\text{PO}_4$) by adding ammonium phosphate (($\text{NH}_4)_2\text{HPO}_4$).
2. Filter, dry, and weigh the precipitate to calculate the percentage of $\text{MgO}$.
2. Filter, dry, and weigh the precipitate to calculate the percentage of MgO.
