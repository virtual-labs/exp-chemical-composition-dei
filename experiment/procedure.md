### Procedure

**a) Preparation of Cement Solution:**
1. Click on the spatula to begin sample preparation.
2. Click on the spatula to weigh sample.
3. Click on the crucible to the cement sample in the beaker.
4. Click on dil. HCL and pour in the sample.
5. Click on the beaker to heat the sample.
6. Click on the funnel to filter the solution prepared.
7. Click on the measuring cylinder to pour the solution in the beaker.

**b) Determination of Calcium Oxide:**
1. Click on the pipette and add ammonium hydroxide $(\text{NH}_4\text{OH})$ dropwise.
2. Click on measuring cylinder to add $10\,\text{mL}$ of ammonium oxalate $((\text{NH}_4)_2\text{C}_2\text{O}_4)$ solution to precipitate calcium oxalate.
3. Click on the the filter paper to filter the solution.       
Click on the filter paper to transfer the precipitate to the crucible.     
Click on the knob of the oven to open it.    
Click on the crucible to heat the precipitate.     
Click on the screen to set the temperature.
4. Click on the crucible to weigh the sample and view results.



**c) Determination of Silicon Dioxide:**
1. Click on the pipette to acidify a portion of the filtrate with dilute nitric acid $(\text{HNO}_3)$.
2. Click on the beaker to heat the solution to dryness to convert silica into insoluble $\text{SiO}_2$.
3. Click on the filter paper to filter the solution.
4. Click on the knob of the oven to open it.    
Click on the crucible to heat the precipitate.     
Click on the screen to set the temperature.
5. Click on the crucible to weigh the sample and view results.


**d) Determination of Iron Oxide and Aluminum Oxide:**
1. Click on the pipette to add ammonium hydroxide $(\text{NH}_4\text{OH})$ until a precipitate forms.
2. Click on the filter paper to filter the precipitate, which contains $\text{Fe(OH)}_3$ and $\text{Al(OH)}_3$.
3. Click on the measuring cylinder to dissolve the precipitate in dilute $\text{HCl}$.
Click on the crucible to transfer the ppt to the beaker.
Click on the pipette to add nitric acid and dil. sulphuric acid.
Click on the beaker to transfer the solution to a conical flask.
4. Click on the knob to start titration.
5. Observe the results after calculation.

**e) Determination of Magnesium Oxide:**
1. Click on the pipette to add diammonium phosphate.
2. Click on the beaker to observe the precipitate.
3. Click on the filter paper to filter the solution and transfer it to a clean crucible.
4. Click on the crucible to start drying in the oven.
5. Click on the screen to set the temperature.
6. Click on the crucible to weigh it.
7. Observe the % of MgO after calculations.
