### Procedure

**a) Preparation of Cement Solution:**
1. Click on the spatula to begin sample preparation.
2. Click on the spatula to weigh sample.
3. Click on the crucible to the cement sample in the beaker.
4. Click on dil. HCL and pour in the sample.
5. Click on the beaker to heat the sample.
6. Click on the funnel to filter the solution prepared.
7. Click on the measuring cylinder to pour the solution in the beaker.

**b) Determination of Calcium Oxide:**
1. Click on the pipette and add ammonium hydroxide $(\text{NH}_4\text{OH})$ dropwise.
2. Click on measuring cylinder to add $10\,\text{mL}$ of ammonium oxalate $((\text{NH}_4)_2\text{C}_2\text{O}_4)$ solution to precipitate calcium oxalate.
3. Click on the the filter paper to filter the solution.       
Click on the filter paper to transfer the precipitate to the crucible.     
Click on the knob of the oven to open it.    
Click on the crucible to heat the precipitate.     
Click on the screen to set the temperature.
4. Click on the crucible to weigh the sample and view results.



**c) Determination of Silicon Dioxide:**
1. Click on the pipette to Acidify a portion of the filtrate with dilute nitric acid $(\text{HNO}_3)$.
2. Click on the beaker to heat the solution to dryness to convert silica into insoluble $\text{SiO}_2$.
3. Filter, wash, dry, and weigh the residue to determine the percentage of $\text{SiO}_2$.


**d) Determination of Iron Oxide and Aluminum Oxide:**
1. To another portion of the filtrate, add ammonium hydroxide $(\text{NH}_4\text{OH})$ until a precipitate forms.
2. Filter the precipitate, which contains $\text{Fe(OH)}_3$ and $\text{Al(OH)}_3$.
3. Dissolve the precipitate in dilute $\text{HCl}$ and determine $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ and $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ using volumetric titration with potassium permanganate $(\text{KMnO}_4)$ and sodium hydroxide $(\text{NaOH})$, respectively.

**e) Determination of Magnesium Oxide:**
1. Use the remaining filtrate to precipitate magnesium ammonium phosphate $(\text{MgNH}_4\text{PO}_4)$ by adding ammonium phosphate $((\text{NH}_4)_2\text{HPO}_4)$.
2. Click on the sample to filter, dry, and weigh the precipitate to calculate the percentage of $\text{MgO}$.
