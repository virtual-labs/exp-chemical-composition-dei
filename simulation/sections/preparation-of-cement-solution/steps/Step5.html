            <h3>About this step:</h3>
            <p>In this step, we will place the beaker containing the cement sample and hydrochloric acid mixture onto the gas burner and heat it gently until the cement dissolves completely. This heating process is crucial for breaking down the cement compounds and ensuring complete dissolution.</p>
            <p>First, the beaker will be carefully positioned on the gas burner, then the flame will be ignited and adjusted to provide gentle heating. The heating should be done gradually to avoid violent reactions or loss of sample due to excessive boiling. Complete dissolution is essential for accurate quantitative analysis as it ensures all the chemical components are available in solution for subsequent analytical procedures.</p>
            <p class="instruction">Click on the beaker to place it on the gas burner and begin heating until complete dissolution.</p>
